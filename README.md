# JPEG-MATLAB-Implementation
This is the raw implementation of JPEG in matlab
jpeg_code.m will take the image as the input and output two files, one with extension myJPEG and another mat file. The file with extension myJPEG is just like jpeg file of the image. mat file stores the huffman coding table. 
myJPEG.m is to read any files with extension myJPEG and reconstruct the image.
This whole implementation is for non-profit purpose.
